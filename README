Installation and prerequisites
----------------------------

Most software needed to run 'Image Filter Lab' is included in a 
package called 'Python(x,y)' which is available for windows and can be
downloaded at 
	http://www.pythonxy.com/
Make sure to choose the 'full' option in the installer.
If an earlier version is already installed, it might be a good idea to uninstall it.
	
	
Sadly, the module 'pyopencv' which is used to access OpenCV functions
from Python is not included in the latest versions  because of lack of 
maintenance. There is a official OpenCV wrapper for Python included 
instead, but it does not work as well. Therefore please download and install
pyopencv-2.1.0.wr1.2.0.win32-py2.7.exe (or the -py2.6 for Python 2.6) from 
	http://code.google.com/p/pyopencv/downloads

	
To make changes and development, the well known Eclipse IDE works great.
There are a few steps to setup Eclipse before you start.
1. Download and install Eclipse from the link below 
	(Choose for example the 'Eclipse IDE for Java Developers' flavor, all of them work)
	http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
	Choose a folder as a workspace and close the welcoming screen.

2. Install the PyDev extension in order to support Python
   by going to menu Help->Eclipse marketplace and search for 'pydev'.		
		Alternatively:  *go to menu Help->Install new software, 
						*click 'Add...' and enter "Pydev" and "http://pydev.org/updates"
						*check and install 'PyDev'

3. Add the project with the source program files by going to 
	menu File -> Import -> General -> Existing projects into workspace
	Select the directory containing the program.
	Switch to the PyDev perspective by clicking in the top right corner of eclipse.
						
4. Add auto-completion for the pyopencv module's function by going
   to menu Window -> Preferences -> PyDev -> Interpreter Python -> 
				Forced builtins tab->New... and type in 'pyopencv'.


To run the program, just run filter_lab.py in the "src"-directory.
There might be some error messages that hasn't been sorted out yet
when closing the program.
